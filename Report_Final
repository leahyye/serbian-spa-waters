# **Introduction**

This study analyzed hydrochemical data for mineral and thermal waters in 
Serbian territory. The authors used principal component analysis (PCA) and 
hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to characterize the chemical composition 
and natural radioactivity of these water samples, understand the relationships 
between the variables measured, and classify the waters with respect to their 
geotectonic units. PCA revealed four latent factors that accounted for 74.2% of 
the variability among the observations. Two of these four PCs are based on 
measures of mineralisation of the components of the host rock, and the other 
two are based on variables that are indicative of natural radioactivity. The 
results of HCA achieved a total correct classification of 83.3% for predefined 
geotectonic units, and the dendrogram produced classified the samples into four 
major groups and eleven subgroups.

# **Methodology**

The Serbian Spa Waters Dataset contains 30 observations(sites), with 15 columns:

-   idNum: Integer - Index of each observation;\
-   waterSource: Character - Spa/Spring the observation belongs to;\
-   tempCels: Numerical - Outflowing temperature (Â°C);
-   pH: Numerical - pH level(Acidity/Alkalinity);\
-   elecCond: Integer - Electrical Conductivity of water measured immediately 
    after collection on the spot, total ion concentration ($\mu$S/cm);\
-   totSolid: Numerical - Total dissolved solids (gL)
-   Ca2: Numerical - Calcium (mg/L);\
-   Mg2: Numerical - Magnesium (mg/L);\
-   Na: Numerical - Sodium (mg/L);\
-   K: Numerical - Potassium (mg/L);\
-   Cl: Numerical - Chlorine (mg/L);\
-   S02: Numerical - Sulfate (mg/L);\
-   HCO: Numerical - Bicarbonate (mg/L);\
-   Si0: Numerical - Silica, dissolved silicon dioxide (mg/L);\
-   geoStruct: Integer - The geological structure the water was collected from 
    (1 = Hydrological Basin, 2 = Karstic terrains, 3 = Volcanogen Massifs, 
     4 = Metamorphic Regions)

Ions $\mathrm{(HCO_3^-, Ca^{2+}, Mg^{2+}, Na^+, K^+, Cl^-, SO_4^{2-}, SiO_2)}$ 
were analysed in the laboratories of the Institute of Public Health of Serbia. 
Titration methods were applied to measure alkalinity of $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$. 
Concentrations of $Na^+$ and $K^+$ were determined by atomic absorption 
spectrophotometry.

Where Hyodrological Basins and Karstic terrains have 5 observations each, 
Volcanogen Massifs has 14 observations, and Metamorphic Regions has 6 
observations. This is an unbalanced dataset since there are varying observations 
per group.

There are no duplicates, missing data, zeros, negatives, NAs or NULL values in 
the dataset.

Our initial exploratory data analysis revealed that the dataset was 
charactarised by high variability and right-skewedness, leading us to perform
a log transformation on the data and use these transformed variables for our
further analysis.
